The tornado crossed into Miami County at 2128EST along Hall Road, about 4 miles east of Pitsburg.  The tornado continued to move east across Miami County, eventually ending at 2144EST, about 4 miles southwest of Troy.

It moved east and entered Miami County at 2128EST along Hall Road, about a half mile northwest of Potsdam. ||As the tornado entered Miami County, significant tree damage occurred on State Route 721 south of Laura. Structural damage began to occur near the intersection of Wright Road and Markley Road, with partial roof loss to an outbuilding. On Ditmer Road and South Shiloh Road, nearly every property sustained tree damage, some of which was significant.||As the tornado neared State Route 571, structural damage became much more severe. Several homes on State Route 571 between South Shiloh Road and South Range Line Road were rendered uninhabitable. Many homes had at least partial roof removal and some sustained complete roof removal. A few homes suffered the collapse of some exterior walls and while this was more common with garage walls, it also occurred on a few well-built walls away from garages. At one home, a lawn tractor was thrown out into the adjacent field to the northeast.||Damage was very similar across the field on South Range Line Road. Two homes experienced complete roof removal, with one also having walls collapse on multiple sides of the second story of the home. Mud splatter on all sides of structures was significant, and one vehicle interior was largely covered in mud after the failure of the rear window. Another home lost a significant portion of the roof, as well as losing quite a bit of material from an interior wall after the winds had entered the structure.  The rotating winds of the tornado were very obvious on this north-to-south oriented road. Along the northern portion of the tornado track, one home lost its entire roof and had it deposited hundreds of feet into the field to the west, opposite the direction of motion of the tornado. Along the southern portion of the tornado track, debris accumulated across the field, along a tree line over a quarter mile away to the east.||The width of this tornado was most evident as it passed east across Elleman Road. Damage was observed as far south as the intersection with State Route 571 and as far north as several spots along State Route 55. While the damage on State Route 55 was primarily to roofing material and trees, more significant structural damage continued to be observed a little farther south on Elleman Road.||The tornado maintained its intensity as it crossed State Route 48 about a mile and a half north of downtown West Milton. Tree damage was severe along this road, with canopy loss even to trees that remained standing. Many structures were heavily damaged or destroyed. The only known injury from this tornado occurred when a trailer home was flipped over. A well-built brick home suffered the collapse of large portions of the west-facing and south-facing walls, with near-complete roof removal. A garage adjacent to this property was flattened. A trailer home just to the south was completely destroyed, with the failure of nearly all exterior walls and even some interior walls. Debris from these homes and structures was carried about a half mile across the field, stopped only by the tree line from traveling farther.||Widespread tree damage and moderate structural damage continued to be observed as the tornado moved east across Calumet Road, Kessler-Frederick Road, and Kessler Road. One home on Kessler Road lost its entire roof and a full-size camper was thrown and wedged against the garage.||Less significant damage was observed after passing Kessler Road, where the tornado turned from the east to the southeast. Damage observed on Nashville Road south of West Kessler Cowlesville Road was limited to trees, and it is believed that the tornado dissipated somewhere in this vicinity.||This tornado was responsible for a lengthy swath of EF2 level damage, generally 120 to 130 mph, extending from State Route 571 to Kessler Road. However, damage to a few homes on State Route 571, South Range Line Road, and State Route 48, was notably more significant, with a combined degree of roof loss and exterior wall collapse that warranted an estimate of 140 mph winds, within the EF3 category.","Thunderstorms developed during the evening hours along a warm front lifting slowly north across the region.

Extensive damage occurred here to a barn, grain silo, trees, and a 19th century residence. The north end of the barn was destroyed and the grain silo was lifted and rolled approximately 150 yards to the northeast. A swirl pattern was evident as well in vegetation along the shore of a pond near where the grain silo fragment came to rest. The back room and associated roof of the 19th century residence was pulled from the main structure, along with the plumbing fixtures and a portion of the concrete sub-floor. The structure and contents of the room and barn were scattered to the northeast along a path approximately 50 yards wide. Several pine trees with trunks approximately 8-10 inches wide were also snapped near the residence. This damage and its dispersal pattern was consistent with 100 to 110 mph winds of an EF1 tornado.||The tornado next crossed County Road 33A between Kettlersville Road and Kohler Lane, damaging power poles along County Road 33A. Two barns and another outbuilding on a property just north of the road were also destroyed. Only small segments of the barns were still standing, suggesting 100 to 110 mph (EF1) winds along this portion of the track. The debris from these structures was scattered over a large area of the adjoining field to the north, northeast and east near the intersection of County Road 33A and Woodland Drive. The tornado likely didn't track directly over this entire area, but instead debris was probably lofted and thrown free of the circulation in many directions, before falling back to the ground nearby.||An absence of damage for approximately 150 yards to the east of the field suggests the tornado briefly lifted, then descended again to strike two more barns and the north side of a house. Both barns lost their roofs and at least half of their exterior walls. Some roof damage also occurred to the house. Debris from these structures was lofted and then dropped to the east in an adjacent field and on both sides of US Route 33.||As the tornado continued east-northeast, it left visible striations in field vegetation and destroyed an outbuilding just west of the County Road 33A overpass across US Route 33. A large portion of the outbuilding was lifted and carried approximately 150 yards to the area just west of the overpass and dropped on the road, where a semi truck crashed into it. The semi driver was injured in the crash. The degree and pattern of damage both here and at the adjacent property to the west are indicative of 100 to 110 mph winds of an EF1 tornado.||No further damage was noted on the north side of US Route 33 or east of the overpass, so dissipation of the tornado likely occurred at this point.","Thunderstorms developed during the evening hours along a warm front lifting slowly north across the region.

Numerous homes suffered significant roof damage and removal, including exterior wall collapse and complete garage destruction. ||The tornado then carved a path east through Trotwood where damage consistent with EF2 wind speeds was widespread and some homes sustained damage consistent with EF3 wind speeds. Structures here again featured roof removal and exterior wall collapse. This was particularly true on the south side of Westbrook Road. A large number of homes and apartment complexes were impacted further east in Trotwood, with most of this damage consistent with high-end EF2 wind speeds.||The highest winds were estimated to have occurred in a corridor from eastern Trotwood (between Shiloh Springs Road and Westbrook Road), then southeast between Shiloh Springs Road and Turner Road, into areas along the Stillwater River/Riverside Drive area. Embedded within this zone was higher-end EF3 damage. Areas near Riverside Drive and the Stillwater River exhibited damage consistent with wind speeds of 170 mph, or lower-end EF4 damage. This damage included well-built apartment buildings that sustained complete roof and exterior wall removal. In addition, significant tree devastation was found along the Stillwater River, east of Riverside Drive, that included numerous trees that were debarked and nubbed down to the trunk.||The tornado continued southeast through Dayton and Northridge, and crossed I-75 into the Old North Dayton Area, where heavy damage continued to homes and businesses. As the tornado entered Riverside, damage began to lessen in intensity, but plenty of damage consistent with EF1 wind speeds was noted. The tornado continued further to the southeast, causing damage in a subdivision north of Burkhardt Road. The roof of an apartment building on Dodge Court was removed.

More significant structural damage was observed at a home on Wolfe Road, where the second level was completely destroyed and removed from the structure. Windows were blown out of cars on the property and a garage was also completely destroyed. Other homes in the vicinity received minor structural damage, including partial roof removal from several homes. Nearby trees were debarked with significant and severe tree damage extending a bit further east. This continuation of severe and widespread tree damage, including large swaths where trees appeared to have been mowed down, was observed via an aerial survey. Sheared off and flattened tree swaths had widths extending at least several hundred feet. It is because of the aerial footage, as well as on-ground survey efforts, that it was determined that the tornado width grew up to one quarter mile in width east of Union Road, leading up to Middle Fork Road. Here, several homes were impacted, with one of the homes severely damaged. A large propane tank had been thrown 20 to 30 feet from its original resting position. Moreover, a 7000 pound truck was thrown into a house. Widespread significant and severe tree damage was observed in this vicinity as well, including several instances of debarking.||The tornado continued on an eastward path east of Middle Fork Road to Long Run Road. Extensive and widespread significant tree damage was observed in this highly forested area. Several more structures along Long Run Road were damaged, either by the tornado itself or by the large trees downed throughout the area. One mobile home had a tree sever the structure in half. Downed trees in this area were several yards in diameter. Here, it is believed that the tornado maintained a width of up to one quarter of a mile.||A bit further to the east, additional but more minor tree damage was observed along Clapper Hollow Road. Tree damage in this area was less severe and less widespread than points further west. Little to no additional tree or structural damage was observed further east of Clapper Hollow Road.

Simultaneously, one low moved along the front from central Indiana to central Lake Erie. Increased surface convergence along the front, ahead of the aforementioned low, allowed an ongoing cluster of multicell thunderstorms to persist northeastward as the storms encountered moderate MUCAPE and effective bulk shear, respectively, in northwest and north-central Ohio during the early to mid-afternoon. ||The surface front and associated horizontal wind shear were probably a rich source of surface-based vertical vorticity. Surface-based effective storm-relative helicity of 100 to about 150 meters squared per second squared and low mixed layer LCL heights near 750 meters AGL resided along the front. All these factors indicated a favorable environment for tornadoes.

Simultaneously, the trailing cold front swept generally eastward from western Ohio to far-southwestern New York and the Ohio/West Virginia border. A quasi-linear convective system (i.e. QLCS) accompanied the cold front as the front encountered a high-shear/low-CAPE environment within the warm sector. ||The high-shear/low-CAPE environment consisted of moderate to strong effective bulk shear of about 40 to 50 knots, 0-0.5 km AGL effective storm-relative helicity exceeding 100 meters squared per second squared, MUCAPE less than 1000 J/kg, mixed-layer LCL heights less than 1000 meters AGL, and weak DCAPE less than 500 J/kg. As a result, the QLCS consisted of a mix of low-topped supercells and multicells. Despite weak MUCAPE, the volatile kinematic environment and low LCL heights in northeast Ohio allowed some mesocyclones and mesovortices to become tornadic. A total of eight tornadoes occurred. In addition to the tornadoes, isolated straight-line wind damage happened and was likely the result of enhanced outflow accompanying mesovortices.",413

Even farther east, a two-car garage was damaged and several two-by-fours were impaled into the ground and roof of a nearby house.","A surface low moved east-northeastward from southern Lake Michigan to Lake Ontario during the morning through early afternoon of April 1st. Simultaneously, the low's trailing cold front moved from the southwestern Great Lakes and Middle MS Valley toward central NY and the Upper OH Valley. Scattered multicell showers and thunderstorms persisted generally northeastward and eastward ahead of, along, and just behind the surface cold front during the wee hours of the 1st and again during the late morning through early afternoon of the 1st. These showers and storms encountered moderate to strong effective bulk shear, weak DCAPE, and weak MUCAPE that increased somewhat and transitioned from elevated to surface-based by late morning as the boundary layer destabilized via daytime heating. Despite the marginally-favorable thermodynamic environment, showers and storms generated sporadic damaging convective gusts and a tornado during the wee hours of the 1st. Additional straight-line convective wind damage occurred during the late morning through early afternoon of the 1st.",472

The tornado began northeast of Nankin, between County Road 801 and OH-58, where several trees were uprooted with snapped branches. As the tornado moved southeastward toward Township Road 713, one residence sustained damage to its roof and chicken coop, while the barn sustained partial roof removal. A separate residence near Township Road 713 and OH-302 suffered damage in the form of a garage door and walls pushed out, and insulation lofted into a nearby field before the tornado dissipated.","A cold front moved into northwest Ohio the evening of Thursday, June 15. A weak surface low pressure developed along this front over southern Michigan earlier in the day and moved southeast across the western tip of Lake Erie during the evening. A warm front extended southeast of this low pressure along the western Lake Erie shoreline and then down towards central Ohio. Thunderstorms erupted along the cold front near Toledo just before 6:00 PM and moved southeast towards east-central Ohio over the coming hours. Enhanced vertical wind shear associated with the low pressure and warm front allowed storms to rotate amidst an unstable environment. A particularly intense supercell (rotating thunderstorm) developed near the Ohio/Michigan border just north of Toledo and tracked across parts of Lucas, Ottawa, Sandusky, Erie, Huron, Seneca, Richland, Ashland, and Wayne Counties. This supercell was responsible for nine tornadoes and numerous instances of large hail, with hail to at least the size of tennis balls reported near Toledo and multiple reports of hail to golf ball sized or larger as the storm continued southeast. Heavy rainfall from this supercell also produced flash flooding across Huron County. Storms gradually congealed into a line that produced some hail and straight-line convective wind damage into east central Ohio.",488

Numerous trees and large limbs were downed and numerous homes and garages had at least some minor roof or fascia damage. The winds were likely the strongest just north of Letson Street, where one garage was flattened and another outbuilding had its roof and second floor removed. Debris from these structures could be found at least a quarter mile downstream. Winds at this location were estimated to be about 90 mph. Additional tree damage and minor structural damage was noted on the east side of Main Street, extending from near the Hardin County Sheriff's Office through Brumm Street.||Additional tree damage was observed on the north side of the Scioto River, near and south of Lick Street.
